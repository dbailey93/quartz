Good afternoon Jaime,

I am planning to come visit your plant next week from Monday to Wednesday (8/21-8/23).

During this visit I have several items I want to investigate into:

- **Shakopee Obsolescence Project in Tandem with Radwell:**

- I plan to do a walkthrough of the plant to identify where all of the electrical panels are located. I have a drawing of the plant and a general idea of the locations, but not enough exactness to be able to give an accurate account to Radwell.

- **Pallet outfeed conveyor controls investigation:**

- I will be working with Jesse Nystrom (or will have him loan me his laptop) to connect to the outfeed conveyors. These are all on a PLC 5 which requires RSLogix 5. I do not posses a copy or license for the software unfortunately, so I will need to borrow what you have on site.
- From the findings I hope to be able to provide some suggestion in preventing this in the future.
- Jesse Nystrom has provided a printout of the program for review, but connecting locally to watch the I/O is the way that this needs to be done to verify all connections are properly functioning.

- **Case Palletizer Programs and potential process improvement opportunities:**

- These palletizers are also on PLC 5s so I cannot view them at the moment.
- Same as the pallet outfeed, I have received the printout of the programs so I can at least do a preliminary review before connecting locally.

- **Repack area counts:**

- Michael Beaver asked me to help with getting a PLC online to relay case counts over to APS. This should be a small project and won’t take priority over the other items on this list.

Thanks,
