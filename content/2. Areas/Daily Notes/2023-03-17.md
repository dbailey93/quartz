#### Issues
**Problem:** 32 cold end spray 
**Cause:** split in water line
**Corrective Actions:** 
- replace water line
- reprime pump to remove air from line
- Secondary issue appeared from shift maintenance not turning the priming function off on the pump
- OPL need to be given to shift workers
**Notes:** 
	- also replaced mixer block with high temp block since the machine was down. While doing so the pressure was too high in the line due to the priming function staying on all night. Caused issues while changing mixer block out and over spray on bottles

**Cause:** chain driving case infeed broken
**Corrective Actions:** 
- replaced chain
