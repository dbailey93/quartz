- #2 devices needed to run in auto
	- This will be determined on the visit next week (09/25)
		- If I cannot go due to 13226 support requests, I can get Will to look in detail for me
	- Overall, it looks as though #2 runs in a semi automatic mode by design. There does not seem to be enough I/O that was added to allow it to run in automatic.
	- Once an audit has been completed on the palletizer, we will be able to determine the possibilities
	- Sample of information to be collected:
		- Motor serial numbers
		- Free I/O
		- Comparison of I/O to Bulk #1, etc
- #6 full pallet rising to top
	- Rekha
	- Need to get confirmation of what photo eyes are controlling the outfeed portion of the palletizer
	- False trigger?
	- Not enough time after a full pallet leaves
		- Add more time to timer
	- Hoist jammed and a full pallet was waiting after?
		- Need to confirm on this.
	- Add photo eye for safety height problem
		- Photo eye would sit above the loading area for the pallets
		- Logic would give an alarm where 
- #1 strapper bayonet extending while pallet moving
	- Need to review code on this one
- All pallet running off end
	- A photo eye has been added to the end of the palletizer out feed
	- This PE will shut off the air bladder for the chains, the chain drive output, and Jesse has been asked to add in some logic to the Strapper to make sure that the strapper cannot run itâ€™s outfeed unless there is an unblocked PE
		- The strapper logic likely has not been completed
	- There is also a pallet stop that is being added by Don Barbee
		- This will need to be added into the same logic that Jesse added for the photo eye at the outfeed conveyor.
		- When the trolley car arrives, that will be the only condition that allows the pallet stop to drop
