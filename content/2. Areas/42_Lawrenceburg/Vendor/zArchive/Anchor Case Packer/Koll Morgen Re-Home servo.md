### How to Reset The Grid Rotate

You will need:
* Computer
* Kollmorgen Workbench
* Ethernet cable

Steps:
1. First you need to make sure that you change your IPV4 address on your computer to the 192.168.1.x network.
2. After your laptop is on the right network you will need to plug your Ethernet cable into the switch located inside the packer control cabinet (any port should be fine)
3. Open the Kollmorgen Workbench software
4. Click on **New Project**
5. Click add new device
	1. You should see the Kollmorgen grid servo on the network
6.  Once connected you should see the left bottom bar populate with options
7.  Click on **Axis**
8.  Click on **Home**
9.  There is a drop down menu at the top that should say something along the lines of "13. Absolute Feedback"
	1.  Click that and change the option to user value
	2.  Make sure the servo has been moved back to a level home position
	3.  If the servo is ready to be saved, click start on the screen closer to the right of the page
	4.  I believe that you will click start one more time to save
	5.  Once done, change the drop down menu back to absolute feedback
	6.  Click **Save to Device** at the very top of the screen
