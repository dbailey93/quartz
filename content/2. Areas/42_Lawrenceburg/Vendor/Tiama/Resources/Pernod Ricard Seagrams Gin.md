**Dimensional Inspection**: 
*  bottom marker as low as possible (close to conveyor)
*  finish marker as high as possible (we never put a marker on the neck)
*  we set the sensitivity for dimensional  inspection between   5 and 10
	*  you have more or less 90 - 95
* for engraved bottles we try to get a brighter image
	* so that the engraving is less visible
* when we learn dimensional inspection we use only 5 bottles
* first we try to find as straight as possible

**Stress Testing**:
* stress testing could be more sensitive

OTHER
* It would not hurt to have an additional zone on the neck
