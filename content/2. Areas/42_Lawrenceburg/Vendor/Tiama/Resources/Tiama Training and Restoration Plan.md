This document serves to propose the Lawrenceburg training plan to restore our Tiama inspection equipment back to ***Standard Operating Condition***. This will highlight the areas of that need improvement from a operator, technician, and mechanic perspective. The areas of focus are:

* <u>Machine Condition</u>
  * Preventative Maintenance: New program with consistent follow through will be established
  * Parts availability will be re-established to expected process
  * Cleaning will take place at determined rate

* <u>Operator Knowledge</u>
  * The expected knowledge will be established and ALL cold end operators will be trained on this material
  * This will include at a minimum how to:
    * read, understand, and clear basic faults/alarms on machines
    * clear jams on machine without damaging equipment
    * keep the machines clean and clear of glass and debris

* <u>Maintenance</u>
  * Comprehensive training with Tiama to ensure that the talent in the facility gets proper training on our current machines
    * The knowledge of our personnel should match the expectation of our results
    * This is a MUST
  * Set-up
    * Basic training on all four machines (Multi, Kompass, MCAL, and MX4) for ALL maintenance personnel
    * Job specific adjustments: flasks, round, square, other, etc.
  * Preventative Maintenance
    * There will be a Tiama assisted program established in Lawrenceburg that will help ***keep*** our machines running in ***Standard Operating Condition***.
      * 6 month suggested
    * This will be integrated into Mpulse (CMMS)
  * Evaluation and Assessment of our current state
    * Compare this against our future state model
* <u>Administration and Engineering</u>
  * Full process understanding
    * Training with Tiama in Maumee
      * MX4 - 1 week
      * Multi, MCAL, Kompass - 1 week
  * Capability
    * What can our machines currently do?
    * Is there any upgrades process changes that can allow for improvement?
    * Bottle size, shape, and feature limitations and opportunities
  * Software integration
    * Tiama Eco?
    * Data tracking on our alarms/faults
    * Accessibility to more than just counts, defects, and rejects
      * Downtime outputs
    * Parameters for recipes (Best Day History)
  * Documentation
    * Generate SOPs for the equipment to support our other functions in the facility
    * OPL for simple items
