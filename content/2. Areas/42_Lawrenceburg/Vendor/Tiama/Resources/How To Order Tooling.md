# **Tooling Purchase Process**

### Purchasing Steps

1. Identify upcoming items that do not currently have an appropriate tooling set
	* If it’s a new item and you are not certain if current tooling can be used, follow the steps below and Tiama will advise if current tooling is adequate.
2. Collect Required information – Mold Number, Shop, Run Date, Bottle Drawing, and Plug Sizes
	* Mold number, Shop, and Run Date can be gotten from plant scheduler
	* Bottle Drawing can be gotten from E&D or New Product Design team
	* Plug Sizes should be filled out per the plug gauging sheet. 
		* All plug sizes should be approved by the quality team prior to submitting for tooling! 
	* Tiama may require samples for some non-round containers to make-up tooling
3. E-mail Anchor Tiama representative requesting new tooling for the item, including the above information
4. Receive quote from Tiama for the requested tooling
5. Submit a PO for the tooling, specifying a need date
6. Receive updated tooling chart from Tiama
7. Receive tooling delivery

### Notes

At the time of this document (9/12/2018) tooling is currently produce at Tiama France, because of this they estimate a **6-week** period between order and delivery. Tiama America is working on building the capability to produce tooling in the US and expect to be able to do this by 2019. This will reduce deliveries to 1-2 weeks.
