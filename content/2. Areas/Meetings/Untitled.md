-   Cadence and structure followed
-   Supervisor received some coaching on flow and detail around quality
-   Tank managers stopping when needed to drill down on specific problems.
-   Continued improvement

Actions Needed:

31 Shop

-   SS Mx4 stopped on off shift and NS Mx4 had just went down due to a PLC Fault. Mahesh notified to assist. Will investigate root cause and prevention. **(Mahesh)**
-   @ Lane Divider Reflector broke off, maybe need to look at the way they are affixed and come up with a more secure solution (Will also disappear with new case packer installation). **(Shane)**
-   Validate that skin blisters are OK **(Leah)**
-   **No support needed from outside of plant**

32 Shop

-   Air line broke once and popped out twice. **(Shane)** Looking into replacement and investigate why we have repeat issues. **(Brent)** to follow up with team.
-   Flap closer out of timing. There was discussion about this being a simple fix but not one that every operator may know how to do. May need to look more into this to see if there is some training that needs done or if there is something we can do to prevent the “out of timing.”
-   Case packer chain repeat issue. **(Brent)** to dig deep into this issue and figure out why it has been a repeat problem. Supervisor saying it appears loose, need to know why.
-   No support needed from outside of plant (Possibly Ruchik assistance with flap closer training or SPL, need to know more first)

33 Shop

-   Chain has broken at palletizer outfeed to trolley. Operator has been manually handling. (Brent/Shane) to repair and find out why it broke.
-   No support needed from outside of plant

34 Shop

-   Palletizer lane divider, jam ups occurring. (Melinda/Shane) continuing to look into. Lanes are set wide to allow for movement from one lane to the other and possibly are getting pushed out with bottles stop. Shane adjusted and will monitor results.
-   No support needed from outside of plant

Palletizer Area: (I will get with Keliche on these today)

-   This area is focus for the day!! I am creating a cadence and something to track our ongoing progress specifically in this area. I will be the owner and gate keeper of this area. Please communicate and inform all progress, failures, and needs to me so I can facilitate.
-   Program issue regarding the “Pairing” of pallets logic getting lost when we run more than one wrapper side. Discussed on 1/13 that David Bailey and Keliche Eke support needed. This forces forklift operator to pick up one pallet at a time at end of wrapper, which causes back ups. If there is too much back up, the wrapper “forget” what its doing and times out and needs reset…therefore causing a snowball of issues.
-   #1 Focus for today is the bander/strapper. I have some detailed information from my discussion with RJ this morning and will share with team. What I can say we need right now is Keliche support. We need training and training docs on how to reset, re-load, and troubleshoot bander. RJ is telling me that not even the maintenance team off shifts are confident here. _I need help digging deep and finding understanding on what all of our root cause issues are at the bander, I am not confident we know what they are at this point._
-   Pop up. Keliche support needed. Need to understand if there are physical weight limits on the pop up as we suspect that specific job loads are more than the machine can handle current state.
