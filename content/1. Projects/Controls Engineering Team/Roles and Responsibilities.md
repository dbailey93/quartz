### Three Levels
#### Design/Development/Projects
#### Optimization/Process Changes/Add-ons
#### Maintenance/Troubleshooting/Support

### Development
1. **Design and Develop PLC Programs:** Create and implement PLC programs using Allen Bradley's software (such as Studio 5000) to control various processes in the glass manufacturing line.
2. **System Integration:** Integrate PLCs with other control systems, such as HMI interfaces, SCADA systems, and MES platforms, to ensure seamless operation and data exchange.
3. **HMI Development:** Design intuitive Human-Machine Interfaces (HMIs) that allow operators to monitor and interact with the production line effectively.
4. **PLC Hardware Selection:** Select appropriate Allen Bradley PLC hardware components based on the requirements of different processes within the glass manufacturing line.
5.  **Stay Current with Industry Trends:** Keep up-to-date with the latest advancements in PLC technology and industry best practices to drive innovation and efficiency in control system designs.

### Optimization & Data Flow
1. **Process Optimization:** Continuously improve control strategies to optimize glass manufacturing processes for efficiency, quality, and safety.
2. **Data Output from IIoT devices:** Build pathways for data transmission to databases to be used for further data analysis. *reword*
3. **Documentation:** Create detailed documentation of PLC programs, wiring diagrams, control narratives, and standard operating procedures for reference and future maintenance.

### Support
1. **Troubleshooting and Maintenance:** Identify and resolve issues in PLC programs, hardware, and communication networks to minimize downtime and maintain smooth operations.
2. **Safety Compliance:** Ensure that PLC programs and control systems adhere to industry safety standards and guidelines, implementing safety interlocks and protocols.
3. **Training:** Train operators and maintenance personnel on the operation, troubleshooting, and basic maintenance of PLC systems.
4. **Remote Monitoring and Support:** Set up remote access capabilities for troubleshooting and support, allowing off-site engineers to diagnose and rectify issues.
5. **Collaborate with Cross-functional Teams:** Work closely with mechanical engineers, electrical engineers, and production managers to ensure the PLC control systems align with overall manufacturing goals.
