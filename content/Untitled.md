​

**Check In Steps:**

- **Gear Check**: Please be prepared to show your Safety Gear (1 safety vest per person, 2 head lamps, 2 tail lights)  
    
- **Confirm Online Check In...** And if you’re reading this prior to race day and haven’t yet completed it, please stop what you’re doing and take a moment to check it off your list! This will save time for you, your team, and all runners following behind you in line!   
    

- If you have not completed Online Check In, you will have to watch the Safety Briefing and complete the waiver onsite.  
    

- **Get Carded:** There will be no bribing the bouncers here, ya’ll! Please bring a photo ID with you to HQ when checking in with your team in order to receive a wristband, which you will wear for the duration of the race. We’ll swap you that wristband for a pull-tab bracelet to access your bourbon tasting... unless you lose it along the way, in which case we’ll kindly ask that you go allllllll the way back to *wherever your ID is* to retrieve it. :)   
    
- Pick up Runner Goodie Bag, Safety Flags, & Runner Bibs  
    
- 10 minutes prior to your start time, check in with the Announcer for your Slap Bracelet  
    

​

***Please note, T-shirt Pick Up @ Exchange 6 ONLY for **both** vans***

### **NIGHT TIME HOURS: 6:30 PM – 8:00 AM**

Safety Gear required during night time hours for runners. 

**All participants must have safety vests when outside of their vehicle.** If you forget on the way to a port-a-potty that’s cool, but we’ll likely ask you to go back to your van and get it. If we ask you to, that’s cool, please just be a good sport and go back and grab it- otherwise you may be subject to a violation (please see Rule Enforcement, below.) And please remember that we don’t want you to pee your pants either, but you’ll definitely pee your pants if you get hit by a car crossing the parking lot. (And I can confirm that a headlamp will come in handy if you accidentally drop your phone in the toilet!) We <3 you. Your teammates <3 you. And hey, they _need_ you- they don’t want to run 200-ish miles themselves! Be safe. Wear the things. 

### ****NO VAN SUPPORT****

The Bourbon Chase does **NOT** allow any van support throughout the entire race.

​

No participants are allowed on course besides the active runner assigned that leg, and vans are not permitted to stop along the course to provide support their runners. 

​

Ragnar will provide a water station(s) on legs longer than 4 miles; please note these water stations are **_cupless._**  Be prepared to bring a drinking vessel of sorts along with you, unless you want to guzzle directly from the spout, which I don’t recommend- there’s a lot of you! 

​

Vans need to follow the van directions specified. There are large parts of the course on beautiful trails that are inaccessible by vehicle.  Please pay attention to the timing of your runner on these legs as several are run at night after dark.   
Van routes apply to those legs designated No Van Support. Please respect the communities we run through and follow the van directions.

​

### RULE ENFORCEMENT

Ragnar Road Races operate on a “3 strike policy”.  Meaning if you break the rules three times, you will be disqualified. This is 3 strikes total, amongst all team members and/or vans associated with the team. I.e. If Van 1 is issued a strike and Van 2 is issued a strike, then there is only 1 strike remaining between both vans. You must provide at least one cell phone number per van during check in to receive notifications from Race Command.  Here are some examples of violations Staff will be enforcing along the course.  Please refer to the Race Bible for a complete listing.  

- Outside of van without nighttime gear during designated night time hours  
    
- Supporting runners on no van support legs or sections  
    
- Crossing roads to support runners (where allowed) without safety flags  
    
- Breaking traffic laws  
    
- Not following volunteer instructions  
    
- Inappropriate van decorations  
    
- Urinating or defecating anywhere outside of a designated portable toilet or restroom (This may result in immediate disqualification or additional strikes)  
    
- Consumption of alcohol on the course (automatic disqualification)  
    

### VAN DECORATIONS

As mentioned above, inappropriate van decorations are subject to a violation. 

​

We want you to have fun and be expressive, however many of our exchanges are local schools and churches and Ragnar has been kindly asked to please not return to certain exchanges or municipalities due to inappropriate van decorations, poor runner behavior,  and general disregard for the communities welcoming us onto their roads and into their venues.

​

We like Kentucky, and we like offering you this race every year. Thank you for helping us mind our P&Q’s (er, snifters and lowballs) and keeping us from being cut us off at the proverbial bar and being respectful of our host cities and exchanges. 

### ****PARKING, PATIENCE, AND POLITENESS**** 

There are several exchanges on this course that have very tight parking areas. The only way we can make this work efficiently is to have each van follow instructions, and be respectful of the volunteers, the facilities, and each other. Please be expeditious in exiting these exchanges and avoid loitering. 

**Exchanges 1,4,5,15,16,19,21,23,25,29**

​

_Exchange 6:_ 

Van 1 parking is available at River of Life Community Church. Please note that you’ll be able to pick up your race tees, hang out with your Van 2 fam, and check our our gear shop. Give yourself plenty of time to park and walk over to the exchange! 

​

Van 2 parking is available at Idle Hour Park. Please allow Van 2 participants to utilize this space so they may depart with their runner in a timely manner. 

### ****FINISH LINE PARKING****

Please park in a legal spot in downtown Lexington.

​

### LOVE THE LOCALS

Please be respectful of our local communities!

- Do NOT support on No Van Support Legs  
    
- Adhere to Quiet Zones on course. Remember - if you’re near homes and it’s in the middle of the night, keep it down!  
    
- Do not litter! Trash bags will be provided in your race bags. Major Exchanges will have dumpsters available to drop trash bags.   
    
- Do not urinate or defecate anywhere that’s not a toilet!
